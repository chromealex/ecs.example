# Example Project
ME.ECS Game Example (https://github.com/chromealex/ecs)

## How to install
* Checkout or download repo
* Open in Unity Editor (Tested in Unity 2019.4.10f1)
* Open "Main" scene
* Press "Play" and Photon will show you steps to set up photon server settings
* Set up PhotonServerSettings (You need to enter your app id)
* Build the game
* Press "Play", wait a while
* Run your build

## Troubleshooting
> Sometimes nothing happens on "Play" if we start 2 builds at the same time

It is happens because each build instance runs its own room, just turn off one of the build instance and start it again.
